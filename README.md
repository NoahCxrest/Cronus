# Cronus 

> ### What is this?
> * This is the code for the Cronus bot. Cronus is a bot that provides support utility and fun commands. You __**need**__ to customize the variables in config.json if you want to use the Cat & Dog commands. (they are the best commands in the bot)
------
> ### Resource Usage
> * Cronus is optimized to be performant in both speed and memory. On my Vertuo server, it uses 24MB of ram and 0.0% of the CPU (idle) & 0.4% of CPU when running any command.
------
> ### Docker Instructions (recommended)
> * Use `docker build -t cronus .` and `docker run -p 4000:80 cronus` to run Cronus.
> ### Non-Docker Instructions
> * If you do not wish to use **Docker** (not recommended), you can simply run `python3 main.py` in your terminal.
------
> ### Support
> * If you for some reason want help running this, contact me on **Discord** [here](<https://discord.com/users/459374864067723275>)
